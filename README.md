# lingo-demo

A repository showing how to get started with training models in Python and deploying models in Go.

The datasets and models used here constitute a toy example intended to illustrate the an approach to deploying Python 
models in Go, thereby accessing the speed and cost efficiencies of using Go for performance-critical ML applications.
